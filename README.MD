### Rules

The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Face cards are worth 10. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end. To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
